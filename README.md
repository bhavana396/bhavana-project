# Multilingual Speech Recognition Model for RAG

## Overview

This project develops a multilingual speech recognition model using pre-trained models like Multilingual Whisper to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to perform tasks in multiple languages without additional training. The system features speech transcription, translation, and querying functionalities.

## Features

- **Multilingual Speech Recognition**: Transcribe audio files in various languages.
- **Translation Pipelines**: Translate transcriptions into multiple languages.
- **RAG Document Querying**: Use transcriptions to query a dummy RAG document.
- **User Interfaces**: Interactive interfaces built with Gradio for ease of use.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **Whisper**: Pre-trained model for multilingual speech recognition.
- **Gradio**: Library for creating user interfaces.
- **Transformers**: Library for translation pipelines.
- **Librosa**: Library for audio processing.



**Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system with all the required libraries
